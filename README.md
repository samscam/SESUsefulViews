It's two useful views which I find myself using in many projects:
                       
* SESCircularImageView is a UIImageView subclass with a circular mask and optional border
* SESGradientView is a UIView with a CAGradientLayer in it

You can instantiate them programatically OR in interfacebuilder by changing the class name of a UIImageView or UIView respectively...
In interfacebuilder you can also set values for the exposed properties of the views like the colours or border width...
